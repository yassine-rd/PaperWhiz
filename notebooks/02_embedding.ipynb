       "      <td>The integration of diverse visual prompts like clicks, scribbles, and boxes\\nin interactive image segmentation could significantly facilitate user\\ninteraction as well as improve interaction efficiency. Most existing studies\\nfocus on a single type of visual prompt by simply concatenating prompts and\\nimages as input for segmentation prediction, which suffers from low-efficiency\\nprompt representation and weak interaction issues. This paper proposes a simple\\nyet effective Visual Prompt Unified Transformer (VPUFormer), which introduces a\\nconcise unified prompt representation with deeper interaction to boost the\\nsegmentation performance. Specifically, we design a Prompt-unified Encoder\\n(PuE) by using Gaussian mapping to generate a unified one-dimensional vector\\nfor click, box, and scribble prompts, which well captures users' intentions as\\nwell as provides a denser representation of user prompts. In addition, we\\npresent a Prompt-to-Pixel Contrastive Loss (P2CL) that leverages user feedback\\nto gradually refine candidate semantic features, aiming to bring image semantic\\nfeatures closer to the features that are similar to the user prompt, while\\npushing away those image semantic features that are dissimilar to the user\\nprompt, thereby correcting results that deviate from expectations. On this\\nbasis, our approach injects prompt representations as queries into Dual-cross\\nMerging Attention (DMA) blocks to perform a deeper interaction between image\\nand query inputs. A comprehensive variety of experiments on seven challenging\\ndatasets demonstrates that the proposed VPUFormer with PuE, DMA, and P2CL\\nachieves consistent improvements, yielding state-of-the-art segmentation\\nperformance.

To handle these\\nproblems, we inherit the advantages of Transformers and propose AerialFormer,\\nwhich unifies Transformers at the contracting path with lightweight\\nMulti-Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (MD-CNNs) at the expanding path.\\nOur AerialFormer is designed as a hierarchical structure, in which Transformer\\nencoder outputs multi-scale features and MD-CNNs decoder aggregates information\\nfrom the multi-scales. Thus, it takes both local and global contexts into\\nconsideration to render powerful representations and high-resolution\\nsegmentation. We have benchmarked AerialFormer on three common datasets\\nincluding iSAID, LoveDA, and Potsdam. Comprehensive experiments and extensive\\nablation studies show that our proposed AerialFormer outperforms previous\\nstate-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance. Our source code will be\\npublicly available upon acceptance.   \n",
       "4  The integration of diverse visual prompts like clicks, scribbles, and boxes\\nin interactive image segmentation could significantly facilitate user\\ninteraction as well as improve interaction efficiency. Most existing studies\\nfocus on a single type of visual prompt by simply concatenating prompts and\\nimages as input for segmentation prediction, which suffers from low-efficiency\\nprompt representation and weak interaction issues. This paper proposes a simple\\nyet effective Visual Prompt Unified Transformer (VPUFormer), which introduces a\\nconcise unified prompt representation with deeper interaction to boost the\\nsegmentation performance. Specifically, we design a Prompt-unified Encoder\\n(PuE) by using Gaussian mapping to generate a unified one-dimensional vector\\nfor click, box, and scribble prompts, which well captures users' intentions as\\nwell as provides a denser representation of user prompts. In addition, we\\npresent a Prompt-to-Pixel Contrastive Loss (P2CL) that leverages user feedback\\nto gradually refine candidate semantic features, aiming to bring image semantic\\nfeatures closer to the features that are similar to the user prompt, while\\npushing away those image semantic features that are dissimilar to the user\\nprompt, thereby correcting results that deviate from expectations. On this\\nbasis, our approach injects prompt representations as queries into Dual-cross\\nMerging Attention (DMA) blocks to perform a deeper interaction between image\\nand query inputs. A comprehensive variety of experiments on seven challenging\\ndatasets demonstrates that the proposed VPUFormer with PuE, DMA, and P2CL\\nachieves consistent improvements, yielding state-of-the-art segmentation\\nperformance.

    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: MiniLM models are smaller and faster than full-size BERT models, which can be a major advantage if you're working on a project with limited computational resources or if you need to process large amounts of data quickly.\n",
    "- Performance: Despite their smaller size, MiniLM models often perform at a comparable level to full-size BERT models on a variety of NLP tasks. This means that you can often use a MiniLM model without sacrificing much in the way of performance. In fact, the `Performance Sentence Embeddings` metric which is the average performance on encoding sentences over 14 diverse tasks from different domains is `68.06` for the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, which is very good to start with.\n",
    "- Ease of Use: If you're using a library like Hugging Face's Transformers, it can be relatively straightforward to load a pre-trained MiniLM model and fine-tune it for your specific task.\n",
    "- Lower Memory Requirements: Given its smaller size, MiniLM requires less memory for training and inference. This could be a crucial factor if you're working with limited hardware resources."
